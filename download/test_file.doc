Professional summary of project (maximum of 300 words)
The tropical rain forests of Africa contain important levels of biodiversity but are undergoing important shifts in response to ongoing global warming and related human actions. The conservation of this biodiversity will start by an appropriate and accurate understanding on plant species distribution and dynamics through time. Data bases documenting species distributions are available but remain independent from each other impeding a concrete view of tropical rain forest biodiversity.
RAINBIO has a double objective in tropical Africa
1) 	Produce an openly-available database of accurate Tropical African plant distributions compiled from existing public and non-public datasets;
2)	 Use this metadatabase for large scale meta-data analyses modelling numerous species distributions at several time intervals using species distribution modelling, past and future climate scenarios, and high-precision African environmental data. Our ambition will be to generate with unprecedented accuracy detailed scenarios of Central African TRF biodiversity dynamics mainly for the future.
These data will form a permanent basis for an adequate biodiversity conservation strategy in the region allowing better conservation assessments in the light of ongoing climate change.
RAINBIO will lean on a large number of databases generated over 20 years and financed by several large scale projects. These datasets will gather around half a million of georeferenced specimens in Central Africa representing distributional information of over 20’000 plant species. The fusion of the databases will be done under the same format allowing easy addition of future data.
The participation in this project of species distribution modelling specialists coupled with new and detailed paleoclimatic data represents one of the strengths in generating robust scenarios about biodiversity dynamics through time. A large number of paleo distribution and future distribution maps will be produced and the results synthesized during the project.

Summary for a general audience (around 300 words). Please write this in French. 
Les forêts tropicales humides d’Afrique abritent une grande biodiversité, mais elles sont menacées par les activités anthropiques et le changement climatique. La protection de ce réservoir de biodiversité passera par une meilleure compréhension des distributions des espèces végétales et de la dynamique de la végétation dans le passé et le futur. Des bases de données sur les distributions des espèces ont déjà été produites, mais elles restent indépendantes ne favorisant pas une vue concertée de la biodiversité des forêts tropicales humides..
Le projet RAINBIO propose de compiler les données mises à disposition par les membres du consortium pour produire une nouvelle plateforme qui sera mise en ligne. Elle contiendra une base de données sur les distributions d’espèces de plantes inféodées aux forêts tropicales humides ainsi que des outils pour modéliser la distribution des espèces et évaluer les statuts de conservation.
Le second objectif de est d'utiliser la plateforme pour modéliser la distribution de nombreuses espèces à plusieurs intervalles de temps dans le passé et le futur. Les résultats permettront d’avoir une vision dynamique de la biodiversité tropicale en Afrique Centrale ainsi que d’évaluer le rôle des forêts refuges pour la conservation. Ces données formeront une base permettant une conservation adéquate de la biodiversité, conduisant à une meilleure utilisation des évaluations des statuts de conservation face aux changements climatiques.

III. Activity report
Describe the main stages of advancement of the project, its main results, and their importance for this particular field of research. Please include some key illustrations and figures. Approximately 8 to 10 pages. You can add documents as Appendices if necessary.
III.1 Description of the work conducted and scientific results obtained

A total of 13 public and private georeferenced tropical African plant specimen databases were concatenated into a single mega database (RAINBIO). The workflow, based on automatic routines and expert opinions of the RAINBIO members, involved quality checks focusing on georeferencing, standardization of taxonomic names and merging of duplicated records. Scripts were constructed to extract habitat information and calculate floristic statistics. RAINBIO was used to provide in-depth analyses of the biodiversity, conservation status and phytogeography of the tropical African flora. State-of-the art species distribution modeling was undertaken on thousands of species in the present and projected into the future under different climatic scenarios.

We produced one of the largest and most reliable African distribution plant databases to date. We also designed a new R statistical package, ConR, for fast multi-species preliminary assessment estimations of conservation status.

RAINBIO contains a total of 614,022 verified geo-referenced records identified to species level (or below) representing distribution data for 25,356 African species of vascular plants and 29,659 taxa (including subspecies and varieties), 3,158 genera in 273 families. Habit information is also available for 91% of these species.

Using RAINBIO, we provide for the first time total estimated numbers of vascular plant species and the level of botanical exploration for all countries across the region of interest. Countries such as Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon and Tanzania stand out as being botanically well explored. In contrast, countries such as Angola or the Republic of Congo remain relatively little explored. African tropical forests are estimated to contain 15387 number of species in total and 3013 species of trees.
Using a novel and rapid method we provide for the first time the state of conservation for the African flora. We show that around 1/3 of the African flora recorded in RAINBIO is likely or potentially threatened by extinction while another 1/3 are likely rare or seldom collected plant species. At the country level, Ethiopia, Tanzania or Sierra Leone contain some of the highest proportions of likely or potentially threatened plant species across tropical Africa.
RAINBIO allowed the reanalysis and definition of new phytogeographic regions for tropical Africa. We also undertook, for the first time, phytogeographical analyses based on habit (patterns of trees, versus lianas etc.). We find that they generally confirm the same results.
Finally, we provide scenarios of tropical African vegetation responses to several scenarios of future climate (2080) change based on species distribution modeling of over 8000 species. These results highlight several regions as potentially negatively impacted by future climate change, mainly in mountain areas (Ethiopia, Tanzania) and the Sahel region in West Africa. Our results highlight areas of potential strong floristic turnover in the Sahel region and parts of the Congo Basin.

III.2 Access to data
Describe the data and/or databases created or added to during the course of the project, and components of a data management plan: the types of data collected and used, standards used to document the data, policy for access and re-use, short- and long-term storage and management, people to contact after the end of the project.
Data and access
RAINBIO contains information on plant distribution in Tropical Africa (south of Sahara and excluding southern Africa). Data are mainly georeferenced herbarium sheets, but also plot data and genetic samples of target species. The format follows Darwin Core which allows easy sharing.
RAINBIO is available for free download at rainbio.cesab.org. Information on child datasets are also available on the same website. It represents a degenerate version of the complete one. This was done as some data providers didn’t want all the info to be open access. Thus available information are: Species name, family, habit, coordinates (lat / long) and accuracy of georeferencing.
All data went through a number of data quality check steps. All the different processes are described in detail in the data paper published with RAINBIO (Dauby et al. 2016).

Future of the project
On the short run, this dataset is being used by several articles directly linked to the project, but also other projects. For example, RAINBIO will be used within the large international project SPARCS (funded by Conservation International) and the “Masai project” (Funding Aarhus University). The database will also now be included in the “Base de données des plantes d’Afriques” managed by the “Conservatoires et Jardin Botaniques de la ville” de Genève (CJG). This portal is the most used (7000 unique hits per month) for access to information of African plant nomenclature and especially distribution (distribution maps based on old range type maps). RAINBIO will be used to update the distribution maps of all species providing an important publicity for our project. Appropriate links will be available.
(http://www.ville-ge.ch/musinfo/bd/cjb/africa/recherche.php?langue=fr)

On the long term we want to take this database further and included more data. One way we shall explore is to collaborate with the BIEN project (https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/featured/enquist) of Brian Enquist (NCEAS, University of Arizona). He has already agreed to collaboration and sharing of analyses methods, scripts and pipelines. This could potentially lead to the generation of a transatlantic plant database, which would be an incredible tool for biodiversity analyses.

Thomas Couvreur will remain the main contact point for the RAINBIO project.
